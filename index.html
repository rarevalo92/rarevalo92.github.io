            <p>My Name is Richard Arevalo. This is a website serves as an autobiography.</p><br />
        <p>I am 23 years old and I attend CSUSB. I hope to graduate in the spring of 2016 with a degree in computer science. As of right now, I work part time at a major retail company GUESS? as an assistant Manager. After graduating I do hope to look for a job within my field of study. Within the field of computer science I would love to narrow down my focus on helping create medical software.</p><br />
        <p> Some of my passions in life are cars, photography, traveling, and fashion. I like to modify my car with new engine or cosmetic parts when money allows me to. My father owns a DSLR which he loves to take out which I use whenever we go on family road trips whether to go site seeing or just having some family bonding. On my spare time I like to keep up to date with the latest trends in different genres of fashion.</p><br />
